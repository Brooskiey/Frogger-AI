Contained here is an implementation of NEAT in Java. It is a project built for learning more about genetic algorithms, specifically NEAT. It is a work-in-progress that contains a few bugs that should be looked after.

We have been executing the code using IntelliJ, so that is what we recommend for it.

Some Bugs:

    Coloring of the agents should be checked. It just looks funky right now.
    Crossover needs to be fully implemented and it might fix other issues such as:
        The list of species in Population being reduced to zero.
    It could generally be more efficient in some areas.

Notes:

    Consider making both an overall champion (one that spans generations) and a generational champion for both Population and each Species. This could help alleviate some headache in areas.
